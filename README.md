## [Documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/)

This documentation has [moved to 11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/).

## Features

* Brings first-class **components** to Eleventy.
  * Expand any HTML element (including custom elements) to HTML with defined conventions from web standards.
  * This means that Web Components created with WebC are compatible with server-side rendering (without duplicating author-written markup)
  * WebC components are [Progressive Enhancement friendly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0wDUK0Z5Nw).
* Get first-class **incremental builds** (for page templates, components, and Eleventy layouts) when [used with `--incremental`](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/#incremental-for-partial-incremental-builds)
* Streaming friendly (stream on the Edge üëÄ)
* Easily scope component CSS (or use your own scoping utility).
* Tired of importing components? Use global or per-page no-import components.
* Shadow DOM friendly (works with or without Shadow DOM)
* All configuration extensions/hooks into WebC are async-friendly out of the box.
* Bundler mode: Easily roll up the CSS and JS in-use by WebC components on a page for page-specific bundles. Dirt-simple critical CSS/JS to only load the code you need.
* For more complex templating needs, render any existing Eleventy template syntax (Liquid, markdown, Nunjucks, etc.) inside of WebC.
* Works great with [is-land](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/partial-hydration/) for web component hydration.
